The GitHub repository you've referenced, figuripv6o/SPYBOMB, is a fork of the original BYTEHACKING-CREATIVE/SPYBOMB. This tool is designed to generate various payloads for multiple platforms, including Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS. 

The file named new merge in the main branch appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete addition, as it lacks a file extension and content.  It's possible that this file was intended for future development or is part of an ongoing merge process. 

If you're interested in exploring or utilizing this tool, I recommend reviewing the original repository for more comprehensive documentation and updates. Please exercise caution and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines when working with such tools.
